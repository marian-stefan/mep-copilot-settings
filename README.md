## Key Features

✅ **Ticket-to-Spec Automation**: Transform requirements tickets into implementation-ready specifications  
✅ **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Jira Analyst → Tech Researcher → Specs Writer → Generic Reviewer (+ review skill) → Git Operator  
✅ **Quality Gates**: Automated validation and quality scoring  
✅ **Git Integration**: Branch creation, commits, optional push  
✅ **Generic Core + Plugins**: Works with any repository structure; technology behavior is plugin-driven

## Quick Start

1. Copy `.github/` folder to your repository root
2. Configure `.github/config/repo.config.json` for your repo
3. Add a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file if one doesn't exist yet — see [GitHub Copilot Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions) for reference
4. Run the `create-specs` prompt or agent workflow
5. Review the generated spec and begin implementation

See [SPECS-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md](SPECS-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Analyze (Jira Analyst)

Extract requirements, acceptance criteria, and ticket context.

### 2. Route (Orchestrator)

Validate issue type and select agents.

### 3. Research (Tech Researcher)

Analyze codebase, identify affected files, plan implementation.

### 4. Generate (Specs Writer)

Create formal specification document.

### 5. Validate (Reviewer)

Check completeness, quality, and coverage.

Validation always uses `Generic Reviewer`.
Technology-specific review depth is resolved from `.github/skills/specs-technology-routing/SKILL.md` via an optional review skill.

### 6. Commit (Git Operator)

Create feature branch, commit spec, optionally push to remote.

## Usage

### Basic

```bash
/create-specs TICKET-123
```

### Auto-push

```bash
/create-specs TICKET-123 --push
```

### Dry-run (local only)

```bash
/create-specs TICKET-123 --dry-run
```

## Configuration

Edit `.github/config/repo.config.json`:

```json
{
  "repoType": "your-stack",
  "specOutputPath": "./docs/specs",
  "ticketSource": "jira",
  "jiraConfig": {
    "host": "https://jira.trimble.tools",
    "projectKey": "PROJ"
  },
  "repositoryInfo": {
    "name": "your-repo-name",
    "language": "your-language",
    "description": "Brief description of repo purpose"
  }
}
```

## Output Artifacts

Three files are created in repository root:

- **`BRIEF-{TICKET_KEY}.md`** - Requirement Brief (from analyst)
- **`CONTEXT-{TICKET_KEY}.md`** - Technical Context (from researcher)
- **`SPEC-{TICKET_KEY}-Plan.md`** - Final Spec (from writer)

Plus a git branch (feature/{TICKET_KEY}) with committed spec.

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Ticket not found | Verify `ticketSource` config and Jira access |
| Git conflicts | Stash unrelated changes, retry |
| Partial data | Review Open Questions in output, update ticket |

See `skills/specs-error-handling/SKILL.md` for detailed error taxonomy.

## Extending for Your Stack

The workflow is fully technology-agnostic. To tailor it for your stack:

1. Set `repoType` and `language` in `.github/config/repo.config.json`
2. Tech Researcher adapts automatically to your language conventions
3. To add stack-specific guidance, create a technology plugin:
    - Register the plugin in `skills/specs-technology-routing/SKILL.md`
    - Follow the plugin structure and resolution rules defined there
    - Add `skills/review-{pluginId}/SKILL.md` for review checks
    - Add `skills/specs-generation-{pluginId}/SKILL.md` for spec extensions when needed
4. Without a plugin, `Generic Reviewer` runs with no extra review skill

## Support & Maintenance

- All agents are polymorphic (auto-adapt to issue type)
- All skills are generic (language/framework agnostic)
- Technology behavior is plugin-driven, not hardcoded
- Ready for replication into other repositories without modification
